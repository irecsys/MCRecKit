MCRecKit is a Python-based open-source library for multi-criteria
recommender systems (MCRSs). It was built upon RecBole v1.0.1. 

MCRecKit implements multi-stage MCRS algorithms, where usually two stages are involved:
1. Predicting multi-criteria ratings by given a user and an item.
2. Aggregating the predicted multi-criteria ratings for either rating prediction or top-N recommendation tasks.

In terms of the second step above, two strategies (i.e., MLP and MC-ranking) 
were provided. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) can be used to estimate the overall rating
from the predicted multi-criteria ratings. The multi-criteria ranking (MC-ranking) can provide
top-N item recommendations directly by utilizing ranking methods (such as Pareto ranking) based on predicted multi-criteria
ratings. CUDA programming was used to accelerate the process of Pareto rankings.

Running Environments
--------------------

The library was tested and run on Python 3.9.20. You can create a conda environment by using:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n mcreckit python=3.9.20
    conda activate mcreckit

Required libraries can be installed using:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

The command above will install CPU-only PyTorch. If you do need GPU-supported
Pytorch, refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for installation.

In addition, for algorithms using multi-criteria rankings (e.g., CriteriaSort), we utilized
CUDA programming for accelerations. Users need to further install cudatoolkit. An example in
conda environment can be shown below:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install cudatoolkit

The library was tested by using the following environments:

- ``python==3.9.20``
- ``recbole==1.0.1``
- ``numpy==1.20.0``
- ``lightgbm==4.5.0``
- ``xgboost==2.1.1``
- ``numba==0.58.1``
- ``pymoo==0.6.1.2``

Note that you may need to downgrade numpy to 1.20.0 for compatibility concerns.

Quick-Start
-----------

With the source code, you can use the provided script for initial usage of our library:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m run_config run/CombRP_Independent.yaml

Data Sets
---------

Three data sets, including ITM-Rec, OpenTable, and Yahoo!Movies, are provided in the ``dataset`` folder.
