MCRecKit is a Python-based open-source library for multi-criteria
recommender systems (MCRSs). It was built upon RecBole v1.0.1. 

MCRecKit implements multi-stage
MCRS algorithms, where usually two stages are involved -- Step 1. predicting multi-criteria
ratings by given a user and an item; Step 2. aggregating the predicted multi-criteria
ratings for either rating prediction or top-N recommendation tasks.

In terms of the second step above, two strategies (i.e., MLP and MC-ranking) 
were provided. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) can be used to estimate the overall rating
from the predicted multi-criteria ratings. The multi-criteria ranking (MC-ranking) can provide
top-N item recommendations directly by utilizing ranking methods (such as Pareto ranking) based on predicted multi-criteria
ratings. CUDA programming was used to accelerate the process of Pareto rankings.

## Running Environments

The library was tested and run on Python 3.9.20. You can create a conda environment by using

```bash
conda create -n mcreckit python=3.9.20
conda actviate mcreckit
```

Required libraries can be installed using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The command above will install CPU-only PyTorch. If you do need GPU-supported
Pytorch, refer to https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for installation.

In addition, for algorithms using multi-criteria rankings (e.g., CriteriaSort), we utilized
CUDA programming for accelerations. Users need to further install cudatoolkit. An example in
conda environment can be shown below.

```bash
conda install cudatoolkit
```

The library was tested by using the following environments:

- `python==3.9.20`
- `recbole==1.0.1`
- `numpy==1.20.0`
- `lightgbm==4.5.0`
- `xgboost==2.1.1`
- `numba==0.58.1`
- `pymoo==0.6.1.2`

Note that you may need to downgrade numpy to 1.20.0 for compatibility concerns.

## Quick-Start
With the source code, you can use the provided script for initial usage of our library:

```bash
python -m run_config run/CombRP_Independent.yaml
```

## Data Sets
Three data sets, including ITM-Rec, OpenTable and Yahoo!Movies, are provided in the 'dataset' folder.
